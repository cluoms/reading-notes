## Stem group sponges

### Reticulosans
	
- taxonomical difficulty

- Several problems assigning reticulosans to crown-group hexactinellids:

	>"hexactines are widely distributed amongst early sponges"

	heteractinids, *Effelia globosa*, Botting & Butterfield 2005
	
	protomonaxonids, Botting et al. 2012, 2013

	laminated spicule construction in *C. loydelli*, Botting & Muir 2013

	*Cyathophycus*, Botting 2003a

	a hezaliid-like sponge containing hexactines, Botting et al. 2017b

	the spicules of *Protospongia* may be calcitic, Page et al. 2009

### Protomonaxonids

> "Two major features of the protomonaxonids preclude a close relationship with any modern group."

	some incoporate hexactine-like spicules, Steiner et al. 1993, Botting et al. 2013

	biminerallic composition in *Lenica*, Botting et al. 2012, 2013, Botting & Pee 2016

	*Pirania* and chancellorids

	Leptomitidae--(*Heteractenigma* Botting & Zhang 2013)--stem group calcareans

### Heteractinids

*Eiffelia* spicules contain a silica core surrounded by a calcitic layer, Botting and Butterfield 2005, Bengtson and Vinther 2006, Bengtson and Collins 2015
	
	organic sheaths in hexactine form, Harvey 2010

	*Calcihexactina*, hexactine preserved in calcite, e.g. Lindstroem 1979, Ding & Qian 1988, Brock &Copper 1993, Wrona 2004

	> "Post-Cambrian heteractinids appear to have been dominantly or exclusively calcitic (e.g. Mehl & Reitner 1996)"

	> "The implication of *Eiffelia* and other anomalous heteractinid sponges is that purely calcitic spicules are a derived condition in which the siliceous component of the spicules in the ancestral lineage has been secondarily lost."
