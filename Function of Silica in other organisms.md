[Silicon improves water use efficiency in maize plants (2005 paper)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/PLN-200025865) probably by precipitating as nano-particals in cell walls and vessel walls, which decreases transpiration rate and water flow in xylem vessels. Treatment with silici acid also decreases uptake of Ca and P.The mechanism of the relation to P is still unclear.

[Silicon reduces sodium uptake in rice (1999 paper)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00418.x/full) basically related to precipitation in cell wall, too. However, the exact mechanism related to the precipitation process is still not clear.
