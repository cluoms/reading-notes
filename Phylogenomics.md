## Ctenophore ancestor

- Botting et al. 2014


- Dunn et al. 2015
	
	not a phylogenomic work but worth carefully reading

- Ryan and Chiodin 2015

	not a phylogenomic work

- Whelan et al. 2015


- Shen et al. 2017
	
	- maximum liklihood framework

	- found resolution in some of these 17 branches rests on a single gene or a few sites
	
	- tiny subsets of very large data matrices drive the resolution of specific internodes
	
	- one detailed example: ctenophore

	Comments: didn't go to details of this papar. But from the abstract, how did the author choose the subset of genes and sites which really matter? Seems that they used the data set of Ryan and Whelan.

## Sponge ancestor

- Nosenko et al. 2013


- [Simion et al. 2017. A large and consistent phylogenomic dataset supports sponges as the sister group to all other animals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217301999)

	- 1719-gene dataset

	- semiautomated dense taxonomic sampling of non-bilaterian animals

	- best-fitting site-heterogeneous evolutionary model
	
	- strong statistical support to placing sponges as the sister group to all other metazoans, with ctenophores emerging as the second-earliest branching animal lineage. 

	- only those methodological settings that exacerbate long-branch attraction artifacts yielded Ctenophora-sister.

	- Porifera is a monophyletic group: (Homoscleromorpha + Calcarea) + (Hexactinellida + Demospongiae)

## Molecular clock

- [Dohrmann & Woerheide (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03791-w)

	- based on the published phylogenomic dataset in Philippe et al. (2009), which includes a fair sampling of all relevant groups

	- Bayesian relaxed-clock

	- all non-bilaterian phyla and th total-group Bilateria, evolved before the snowball earth (~720-635 Ma)
	
	Comments: ancient evolvement of the gene repository, but not necessarily the pheno-features...
