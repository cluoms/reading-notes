Botting et al.(2017 review)'s comment on Du and Wang (2012) (Doushantuo spicules)

> This point needs reiterating: some radiolarian structures can appare as small but perfectly-formed hexactine or pentactine spicules, complete with axial canals ([Afanasieva and Amon, 2013, pl. 3, fig. 15](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0031030113100031)).Recongnition of definite hexactine-based spicules therefore relies on large size, morphological modifications, or (most crucially) articulated preservation.

*Comments:*

1 Need to be cautious when interpreting early spicular fossils.
2 If Du and Wang (2012)'s materials are reliable, it is also a new finding that radiolarian occured in the Ediacaran

> The presence of radiolarians in the Lower Cambrian Hetang and Kuanchuanpu formations and the material from Jiuqunao, Hubei Province, China has to be regarded as a contamination with younger material. Oldest genuine radiolarians are recognized in Stage 5 (Series 3) of tje Cambrian System, leaving the biostratigraphical and evolutionary origin of radiolarians in the early Cambrian undecided.
